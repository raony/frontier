# Active Context - Current Development

## Recent Changes

### Weight System Implementation (Completed)
- **Added `WeightMixin`** to `typeclasses/objects.py` - provides weight functionality to all objects
- **Updated base `Object` class** to include `WeightMixin` by default
- **Added weight properties** to all item typeclasses with realistic default weights:
  - Basic objects: 100g default
  - Food items: 50g (simple), 200g (portioned), 800g (roasted chicken)
  - Equipment: 50g (hands), 100g (waist), 150g (head), 200g (feet), 300g (legs), 500g (body)
  - Tools: 300g (torch), 150g (liquid containers)
- **Created weight commands** in `commands/weight.py`:
  - `weight` / `wt` - show inventory weight or specific item weight
  - `setweight` - Builder command to set item weights
- **Added commands to command sets** in `commands/default_cmdsets.py`
- **Created comprehensive tests** in `tests/test_weight_system.py`
- **Test reorganization**: Removed hold/release tests from `test_hold_and_light.py`, renamed to `test_light.py`

### Weight System API
- **`get_weight()`** - Returns weight in grams (int)
- **`set_weight(weight)`** - Sets weight in grams (int, non-negative)
- **`weight_default`** - Class attribute for default weight
- **`db.weight`** - Persistent attribute storing weight value

### Usage Examples
```python
# In-game commands
weight                    # Show total inventory weight
weight apple             # Show specific item weight
weight all               # List all items with weights
setweight sword = 1200   # Set item weight (Builder only)

# In code
obj.get_weight()         # Get weight in grams
obj.set_weight(500)      # Set weight to 500g
obj.weight_default = 200 # Set default for new instances
```

## Current Focus
- Weight system is now fully implemented and tested
- All existing items have appropriate default weights
- Commands are available for players and builders
- System follows Evennia patterns with persistent attributes
- All tests passing (65/65)

## Next Steps
- Consider weight-based carrying capacity limits
- Add weight to character encumbrance calculations
- Integrate weight with movement/travel systems
- Add weight-based crafting requirements

## Development Patterns

### Code Style
- **Pythonic, readable, explicit names**
- **Business logic in typeclasses/commands**
- **Configuration in server/conf**
- **Comprehensive documentation**

### Evennia Integration
