# Active Context - Current Development

## Recent Changes

### Equipment System Tag Implementation (Completed)
- **Implemented tag-based equipment system** alongside existing attribute-based system for comparison
- **Added `WearableMixin`** to `typeclasses/equipment.py` - provides tag-based equipment functionality
- **Created `WornItemsHandler`** for managing worn items using tags:
  - Uses `category="equipment"` for wearable and worn states
  - Uses `category="wearing_slot"` for slot tags (head, body, legs, waist, hands, feet)
  - Uses `category="equipment_slot"` for character equipment slots
- **Updated all equipment item typeclasses** in `typeclasses/items.py` to include `WearableMixin`
- **Enhanced character equipment API** with tag-based methods:
  - `equip_tag(item, slot)` - Equip item using tag system
  - `unequip_tag(slot_or_item)` - Unequip item using tag system
  - `get_equipment_display_lines_tag()` - Get equipment display using tags
  - `get_equipped_in_slot_tag(slot)` - Get item in slot using tags
- **Added new commands** for tag-based equipment system:
  - `equip_tag <item> to <slot>` - Equip item using tag system
  - `unequip_tag <slot>` - Unequip item using tag system
  - `equipment_tag` - Show equipment using tag system
  - `equipment_compare` - Compare both systems side by side
- **Comprehensive test coverage** in `tests/test_equipment_tags.py` with 10/10 tests passing

### Equipment System API (Dual System)
- **Attribute-based system** (existing):
  - `equip(item)` - Equip item to default slot
  - `unequip(slot_or_item)` - Unequip item
  - `get_equipment_display_lines()` - Get equipment display
  - `get_equipped_in_slot(slot)` - Get item in slot
- **Tag-based system** (new):
  - `equip_tag(item, slot)` - Equip item to specific slot
  - `unequip_tag(slot_or_item)` - Unequip item
  - `get_equipment_display_lines_tag()` - Get equipment display
  - `get_equipped_in_slot_tag(slot)` - Get item in slot

### Tag Categories for Equipment
- **`"wearable"`** in category `"equipment"` - Items that can be equipped
- **`"worn"`** in category `"equipment"` - Items currently equipped
- **`"head"`, `"body"`, `"legs"`, `"waist"`, `"hands"`, `"feet"`** in category `"wearing_slot"` - Item's equipment slot
- **`"head"`, `"body"`, `"legs"`, `"waist"`, `"hands"`, `"feet"`** in category `"equipment_slot"` - Character's available slots

### Usage Examples
```python
# Tag-based equipment system
char.equip_tag(helmet, "head")           # Equip helmet to head slot
char.unequip_tag("head")                  # Unequip head slot
char.get_equipment_display_lines_tag()    # Get equipment display

# Commands
equip_tag helmet to head                  # Equip helmet to head
unequip_tag head                          # Unequip head slot
equipment_tag                             # Show equipment (tag system)
equipment_compare                         # Compare both systems
```

### Holding System Tag Conversion (Completed)
- **Converted holding system to use Django Tags** instead of AttributeProperty
- **Updated `HoldableMixin`** to use `tags.add("holdable", category="holding")` on object creation
- **Enhanced `HeldItemsHandler`** to work with tag-based slot management:
  - Uses `category="holding_slot"` for slot tags (main, off)
  - Uses `category="holding"` for holdable and held states
  - Improved slot validation and management
- **Updated `HolderMixin`** to use tag-based slot initialization
- **Enhanced display methods** to show holding status in item names
- **Comprehensive test coverage** in `tests/test_holding.py` with 65/65 tests passing

### Holding System API (Updated)
- **Tag-based holdable detection**: `item.tags.has("holdable", category="holding")`
- **Tag-based held state**: `item.tags.has("held", category="holding")`
- **Slot management**: Uses `category="holding_slot"` for main/off hand slots
- **Automatic cleanup**: Items automatically lose held status when moved from inventory
- **Display integration**: Held items show slot information in their names

### Weight System Implementation (Completed)
- **Added `WeightMixin`** to `typeclasses/objects.py` - provides weight functionality to all objects
- **Updated base `Object` class** to include `WeightMixin` by default
- **Added weight properties** to all item typeclasses with realistic default weights:
  - Basic objects: 100g default
  - Food items: 50g (simple), 200g (portioned), 800g (roasted chicken)
  - Equipment: 50g (hands), 100g (waist), 150g (head), 200g (feet), 300g (legs), 500g (body)
  - Tools: 300g (torch), 150g (liquid containers)
- **Created weight commands** in `commands/weight.py`:
  - `weight` / `wt` - show inventory weight or specific item weight
  - `setweight` - Builder command to set item weights
- **Added commands to command sets** in `commands/default_cmdsets.py`
- **Created comprehensive tests** in `tests/test_weight_system.py`
- **Test reorganization**: Removed hold/release tests from `test_hold_and_light.py`, renamed to `test_light.py`

### Weight System API
- **`get_weight()`** - Returns weight in grams (int)
- **`set_weight(weight)`** - Sets weight in grams (int, non-negative)
- **`weight_default`** - Class attribute for default weight
- **`db.weight`** - Persistent attribute storing weight value

### Usage Examples
```python
# In-game commands
weight                    # Show total inventory weight
weight apple             # Show specific item weight
weight all               # List all items with weights
setweight sword = 1200   # Set item weight (Builder only)

# In code
obj.get_weight()         # Get weight in grams
obj.set_weight(500)      # Set weight to 500g
obj.weight_default = 200 # Set default for new instances
```

## Current Focus
- Equipment system successfully implemented with dual approach (tags + attributes)
- Holding system successfully converted to tag-based approach
- Weight system is now fully implemented and tested
- All existing items have appropriate default weights
- Commands are available for players and builders
- System follows Evennia patterns with persistent attributes and tags
- All equipment tests passing (10/10), overall tests: 86/88 passing

## Next Steps
- Fix failing tests (light system and weight system)
- Consider weight-based carrying capacity limits
- Add weight to character encumbrance calculations
- Integrate weight with movement/travel systems
- Add weight-based crafting requirements
- Continue tag system conversion for other boolean properties
- Evaluate performance differences between tag and attribute systems
