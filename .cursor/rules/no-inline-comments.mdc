Do NOT add inline comments or section comments to code unless explicitly requested by the user.

Avoid adding comments like:
- `# Argument validation`
- `# Object search`
- `# Perform action`
- `# Check if...`
- `# Get the...`

The code should be self-documenting through:
- Clear variable names
- Descriptive function names
- Logical code structure
- Good docstrings

Only add comments when:
- The user specifically asks for comments
- Complex business logic needs explanation
- There are non-obvious implementation details
- Documenting why something is done a certain way (not what is being done)

Keep the code clean and readable without unnecessary commentary.
