When working with command classes (files in `commands/` directory or any file containing Evennia command classes that inherit from `Command` or `MuxCommand`), ALWAYS read and follow the patterns documented in `.cursor/memory/command-writing-patterns.md`.

This file contains essential patterns for:
- Argument parsing using `self.lhs`, `self.rhs`, and `self.caller`
- Object search with `caller.search_item()`
- Display names using `self.get_display_name(obj)`
- Message broadcasting with `caller.location.msg_contents()`
- Using `DisplayNameWrapper` for object mapping
- Error handling and validation patterns
- Standard command structure and organization

Reference this file before writing any new commands or modifying existing command classes to ensure consistency with established patterns.
